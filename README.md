### Editing Questions

2. By right-clicking and selecting "Open Web Question Assistant" on a website that already has a question

## Modifying Data

### Google Sheet Integration

The extension gets its data from a Google Sheet at:
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uIizPuQ7ILmI8k3P7OGfWOe_MkMTVZWQX165bq3_aJM/edit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uIizPuQ7ILmI8k3P7OGfWOe_MkMTVZWQX165bq3_aJM/edit)

This Google Sheet has a simple structure:

```
website,question
google.com,What are you?
youtube.com,How are you doing?
facebook.com,Are you okay?
```

To modify the data:
1. Edit the Google Sheet directly (recommended for data synchronization)
2. Use the extension's UI to add, edit, or delete entries (changes are saved locally)

When you make changes through the extension UI, they are saved locally. To synchronize these changes with the Google Sheet, you must manually update the sheet.

### Local Data

The extension also includes a local copy of the data in `data/data.csv` as a fallback.

## Configuration

You can customize the extension by editing the `config.js` file:

- Change the extension name
- Modify the color theme
- Update the data source path or Google Sheet URL

```javascript
// In config.js
const config = {
  // App information
  appName: "Web Question Assistant",
  
  // Theme configuration
  theme: {
    primaryColor: "#88D498", // Pastel green
    ...
  },
  
  // Data source configuration
  dataSource: {
    path: "data/data.csv",
    googleSheet: {
      id: "1uIizPuQ7ILmI8k3P7OGfWOe_MkMTVZWQX165bq3_aJM",
      url: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uIizPuQ7ILmI8k3P7OGfWOe_MkMTVZWQX165bq3_aJM/export?format=csv&gid=0"
    },
    ...
  }
};
```
